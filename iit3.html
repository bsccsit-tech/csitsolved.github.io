						<div>
						<h3>Memory Representation  </h3>
						
We store data in computer so it is important to know how
different types of data (text, integer etc.) can represent in
memory.<br>
Bits, bytes, and words:<br>
The most fundamental unit of computer memory is the bit and
it can only take one of two values: it is either 0 or 1.
A collection of 8 bits is called a byte and a collection of 4
bytes, or 32 bits, is called a word.<br>

The number of bytes and words used for an individual data
value will vary depending on the storage format (OS,
computer hardware) but in many cases, a single letter or
character of text takes up one byte and an integer number
takes up one word. A real or decimal number takes up one
or two words depending on how it is stored.<br>
For example, the text “hello” would take up 5 bytes of
storage, one per character. The text “12345” would also
require 5 bytes. The integer 12,345 would take up 4 bytes (1
word), as would the integers 1 and 12,345,678. The real
number 123.45 would take up 4 or 8 bytes, as would the
values 0.00012345 and 12345000.0.<br>

						<a id="Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal </h3>
						A single byte of memory that contains the letter `A' (ASCII
code 65; binary 1000001).<br>
01000001<br>
							
							<a id="Octal"></a>
							<h3>Octal</h3>
Octal: A more convenient notation is octal, where each digit
represents a value from 0 to 7. Each octal digit is the
equivalent of 3 binary digits, so a byte of memory can be
represented by 3 octal digits.<br>
Example: the binary code of character `A' splits into triplets of
binary digits (from the right) like this: 01 000 001. So the octal
digits are 101, commonly written 0101 to emphasize the fact
that these are octal digits.<br>

<br>
			<a id="Hexadecimal"></a>
							<h3>Hexadecimal</h3>
Hexadecimal: An even more efficient way to represent
memory is hexadecimal form. Each digit represents a value
between 0 and 16, with values greater than 9 replaced with
the characters A to F.<br>
A single hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 bits, so each
byte of memory requires only 2 hexadecimal digits.
The binary form for the character `A' splits into two
quadruplets: 0100 0001. The hexadecimal digits are 41<br>
<a id="Numbers"></a>

							<h3>Numbers</h3>Numbers: If we use two bits together to store a number,
each bit has two possible states, so there are four possible
combined states and each state to represent a different
number.<br>
▪ For example, the four possible states for 2 bits are 00, 01,
10, 11 and could store four numbers using two bits: 0, 1,
2, and 3. This representation is called binary notation.<br>
▪ In general, if we use k bits, each bit has two possible
states, and the bits combined can represent 2k possible
states, so with k bits, we could represent the numbers
0,1,2 up to 2 k - 1.<br>
<a id="Integers"></a>
							<h3>Integers</h3>
Integers: Integers are commonly stored using a word of
memory, which is 4 bytes or 32 bits, so integers from 0 up to
4,294,967,295 (232 - 1) can be stored. Below are the
integers 1 to 5 stored as four-byte values (each row
represents one integer).<br>
0 : 00000001 00000000 00000000 00000000 | 1<br>
4 : 00000010 00000000 00000000 00000000 | 2<br>
8 : 00000011 00000000 00000000 00000000 | 3<br>
12 : 00000100 00000000 00000000 00000000 | 4<br>
16 : 00000101 00000000 00000000 00000000 | 5<br>

						<a id="Memory and its classification"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> Memory and its classification </h3>
						⚫ Computer memory in generic term is an electronic circuit
to store a data in computer.<br>
⚫ It uses a different types of data storage technology
including RAM, ROM, flash memory and secondary
storage.<br>
⚫ Another way, computer memories are non-volatile and
Volatile type<br>
⚫ Non-Volatile means they can store data on a long term
basis even when there is no power and volatile which are
often faster but lose all the data stored on them as soon
as the power is switched off.<br>
							⚫ A computer system is built using a combination of these
types of computer memory, and the exact configuration
can be optimized to produce the maximum data
processing speed or the minimum cost, or some
compromise between the two.<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Types of computer memory"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Types of computer memory  </h3>
						<br>
							<a id="Primary Memory"></a>
							<h3>Primary Memory</h3>
							
⚫ Primary memory includes ROM and RAM, and is located close to
the CPU on the computer motherboard, enabling the CPU to read
data from primary memory very quickly indeed. It is used to store
data that the CPU needs imminently so that it does not have to wait
for it to be delivered.<br>
<br>
							<a id="Secondary Memory"></a>
							<h3>Secondary Memory</h3>
⚫ Secondary memory by contrast, is usually physically located within
a separate storage device, such as a hard disk drive or solid state
drive (SSD), which is connected to the computer system either
directly or over a network. The cost per gigabyte of secondary
memory is much lower, but the read and write speeds are
significantly slower.<br>

<br>
							<a id="Types of Primary memory"></a>
							<h3>Types of Primary memory</h3>
▪ With computer evolution, many computer memory types has been
deployed, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.<br>
There are two key types of primary memory:<br>
▪ RAM = Random Access Memory<br>
▪ ROM = Read Only Memory<br>
						</div>
						<a id="RAM Computer Memory"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>RAM Computer Memory  </h3>
						⚫ RAM stems from the fact that data stored in Random Access Memory can be
accessed in any random order.<br>
⚫ RAM memory is very fast both in write and read.<br>
⚫ It is volatile (so all data stored in RAM memory is lost when it loses power).<br>
⚫ It is very expensive compared to all types of secondary memory in terms of
cost per gigabyte.<br>
⚫ It is because of the relative high cost of RAM compared to secondary memory
types that most computer systems use both primary and secondary memory.<br>
⚫ Data that is required for imminent processing is moved to RAM where it can
be accessed and modified very quickly, so that the CPU is not kept waiting.<br>
⚫ When the data is no longer required it is shunted out to slower but cheaper
secondary memory, and the RAM space that has been freed up is filled with
the next chunk of data that is about to be used.<br>

<a id="Types of RAM"></a>
							<h3>Types of RAM</h3>
							<a id="DRAM (Dynamic RAM)"></a>	
							<h3>DRAM (Dynamic RAM)</h3>
	
▪ It is the most common type of RAM used in computers.<br>
▪ The oldest type is known as Single Data Rate (SDR) DRAM<br>
▪ Newer computers use faster Dual Data Rate (DDR) DRAM.<br>
▪ DDR comes in several versions including DDR2 , DDR3, and DDR4,
which offer better performance and are more energy efficient than
DDR.<br>
▪ It is not possible to mix DDR2 with DDR3 DRAM in a computer
system. Different versions are incompatible.<br>
						<a id="SRAM"></a>
							<h3>SRAM</h3>
							<br>▪ SRAM is Faster than DRAM<br>
▪ More expensive and bulker, having six transistors in each
cell.<br>
▪ For those reasons SRAM is generally only used as a data
cache within a CPU itself or as RAM in very high-end
server systems.<br>
▪ A small SRAM cache of the most imminently-needed data
can result in significant speed improvements in a system<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Cache Memory"></a>
						<div>
							
						<h3> Cache Memory </h3>
					<br>	⚫ Cache Memory is a special very high-speed memory used to speed up and
synchronizing with high-speed CPU.<br>
⚫ Cache memory is costlier than main memory or disk memory but economical
than CPU registers.<br>
⚫ Cache memory is an extremely fast memory type that acts as a buffer
between RAM and the CPU. It holds frequently requested data and
instructions so that they are immediately available to the CPU when needed.<br>
⚫ Cache memory is used to reduce the average time to access data from the
Main memory. The cache is a smaller and faster memory which stores copies
of the data from frequently used main memory locations.<br>

						<div>
						<h3>ROM Computer Memory  </h3>
						▪ ROM (read-only memory) means data can be read from this type of memory, data
cannot normally be written to it.<br>
▪ It is a very fast type of computer memory which is usually installed close to the
CPU on the motherboard.<br>
▪ ROM is a type of non-volatile memory, which means that the data stored in ROM
persists in the memory even when it receives no power. In that sense it is similar
to secondary memory, which is used for long term storage.<br>
▪ When a computer is turned on, the CPU can begin reading information stored in
ROM without the need for drivers or other complex software to help it
communicate.<br>
▪ The ROM usually contains "bootstrap code" which is the basic set of instructions a
computer needs to carry out to become aware of the operating system stored in
secondary memory, and to load parts of the operating system into primary
memory so that it can start up and become ready to use.<br>
▪ ROM is also used in simpler electronic devices to store firmware which runs as
soon as the device is switched on.<br>
<a id="Types of ROM"></a>
							<h3>Types of ROM</h3>
<br>
		<a id="ROM(or Masked ROM)"></a>
		<h3>ROM(or Masked ROM)</h3>					
▪ ROM(or Masked ROM) Preprogrammed set of data or instructions
are stored in ROM. The contents of such ROMs have to be
specified before chip production. ROM is available in several
different types, including PROM, EPROM, EEPROM and Flash
ROM.<br>
		<a id="PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory)"></a>
							<h3>PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory)</h3>
▪ PROM (Programmable Read-Only Memory), and it is different from
true ROM. ROM is programmed during the manufacturing process,
a PROM is manufactured in an empty state and then programmed
later using a PROM programmer or burner.<br>
							<a id="EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)"></a>
							<h3>EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)</h3>
▪ EPROM (Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) and data
stored in an EPROM can be erased and the EPROM
reprogrammed. Erasing an EPROM involves removing it from the
computer and exposing it to ultraviolet light before re-burning it.
Memory and its classification<br>
							<a id="EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)"></a>
							<h3>EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory)</h3>
▪ EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only
Memory). Distinction between EPROM and EEPROM is that the
latter can be erased and written to by the computer system it is
installed in. EEPROM is not strictly read-only. However in many
cases the write process is slow, so it is normally only done to update
program code such as firmware or BIOS code on an occasional
basis.<br>
	<a id="Flash ROM"></a>
							<h3>Flash ROM</h3>
▪ Flash ROM: Also called Flash BIOS or flash memory. This memory
should be constantly powered and act as non-volatile memory in
computer. Function of Flash ROM are<br>
							<a id="POST"></a>
							<h3>Power On Self Test(POST)</h3>
▪ Power On Self Test(POST) – Checks the major hardware components<br>
						<a id="BIOS Setup program"></a>	
							<h3>BIOS Setup program</h3>
▪ BIOS Setup program – built in utility in BIOS which control how the computer<br>
works i.e. system settings, find bootable devices, interrupt handlers and
device drivers<br>
					<a id="Bootstrap loader"></a>
							<h3>Bootstrap loader</h3>
▪ Bootstrap loader: is a program to start the computer software for operation
when the power is ON.<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Types of Secondary memory"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Types of Secondary memory  </h3>
						Secondary memory comprises many different storage media which can
be directly attached to a computer system. These include:<br>
▪ Hard disk drives<br>
▪ Solid State Drives (SSDs)<br>
▪ Optical (CD or DVD) drives<br>
▪ Tape drives<br>
Secondary memory also includes:<br>
▪ Storage arrays including 3D NAND flash arrays connected over a
Storage Area Network (SAN)<br>
▪ Storage devices which may be connected over a conventional
network (known as network attached storage, or NAS)<br>
▪ Cloud storage can also be called secondary memory.<br>

						<a id="Network Attached Storage (NAS)"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> Network Attached Storage (NAS) </h3>
						NAS systems are
networked appliances which contain one or more
storage drives, often arranged into logical, redundant
storage containers or RAID. Network-attached storage
removes the responsibility of file serving from other
servers on the network.<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Input devices, Output devices, Interfaces"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Input devices, Output devices, Interfaces </h3>
						▪ An input device sends information to a computer system
for processing, and an output device reproduces or
displays the results of that processing.<br>
▪ Input devices only allow for input of data to a computer
and output devices only receive the output of data from
another device.<br>
▪ Most devices are only input devices or output devices, as
they can only accept data<br> input from a user or output data
generated by a computer.
▪ However, some devices can accept input and display
output, and they are referred to as I/O devices
(input/output devices).<br>
<a id="Input devices"></a>
							<h3>Input devices</h3>
Input devices:<br>
An input device can send data to another device, but it
cannot receive data from another device. Examples of input
devices include the following.<br>

							<h3>Output devices</h3>
Output devices:<br>
An output device can receive data from another device and
generate output with that data, but it cannot send data to
another device. Examples of output devices include the
following.<br>
▪ Monitor - Receives data from a computer (output) and displays that
information as text and images for users to view. It cannot accept data
from a user and send that data to another device.<br>
▪ Projector - Receives data from a computer (output) and displays, or
projects, that information as text and images onto a surface, like a wall or
a screen. It cannot accept data from a user and send that data to another
device.<br>
▪ Speakers - Receives sound data from a computer and plays the sounds
for users to hear. It cannot accept sound generated by users and send
that sound to another device.<br>

<a id="Input/output devices"></a>
							<h3>Input/output devices</h3>
Input/output devices:<br>
An input/output device can receive data from users, or
another device (input), and send data to another device
(output). Examples of input/output devices include the
following.<br>
▪ CD-RW drive and DVD-RW drive - Receives data from a
computer (input), to copy onto a writable CD or DVD. Also,
the drive sends data contained on a CD or DVD (output)
to a computer.<br>
▪ USB flash drive - Receives, or saves, data from a
computer (input). Also, the drive sends data to a computer
or another device (output).<br>
Note: Drives such as a CD-ROM, DVD, floppy diskette drive, and USB flash drive are also considered storage devices.
Input devices, Output devices, Interfaces
<br>
▪ Input Output Interface provides a method for transferring
information between internal storage and external I/O
devices.<br>
▪ Peripherals connected to a computer need special
communication links for interfacing them with the central
processing unit.<br>
▪ The purpose of communication link is to resolve the
differences that exist between the central computer and
each peripheral.<br>

Input - Output Interface:<br>
CPU and device controllers all use a common bus for communication
<br>
The Major Differences are:-<br>
1. Peripherals are electromechnical and electromagnetic devices and CPU and
memory are electronic devices. Therefore, a conversion of signal values may be
needed.<br>
2. The data transfer rate of peripherals is usually slower than the transfer rate of CPU
and consequently, a synchronization mechanism may be needed.<br>
3. Data codes and formats in the peripherals differ from the word format in the CPU
and memory.<br>
4. The operating modes of peripherals are different from each other and must be
controlled so as not to disturb the operation of other peripherals connected to the
CPU.<br>
To Resolve these differences, computer systems include special hardware
components between the CPU and Peripherals to supervises and synchronizes all
input and out transfers<br>
▪ These components are called Interface Units because they interface between the
processor bus and the peripheral devices.<br>

<a id="Access Types Storage Devices"></a>
							<h3>1. Access Types Storage Devices</h3>

				<a id="Sequential Access"></a>
							<h3>1.Sequential Access</h3>
<br> Sequential access means the data is
written or read in sequence one after another and can’t go
directly to the desired location without going through all
preceding locations.<br>
Example: Magnetic Tape<br>
A magnetic tape is a storage medium that
allows for data archiving, collection, and
backup. At first, the tapes were wound in
wheel-like reels, but then cassettes and
cartridges came along, which offered more
protection for the tape inside.<br>

<a id="Direct Access"></a>
							<h3>2. Direct Access</h3>
<br> Direct access devices are the ones in which
any piece of data can be retrieved in a non-sequential manner
by locating it using the data’s address. The device is called
random access because any data from any location can be
read or written directly.<br>
Example: Magnetic Disk<br>
Data keeps in magnetized materials.<br>
Magnetic storage offers high storage
capacity, reliability, and the capacity to
directly accessing data. Data can be
accessed randomly from magnetic disk.<br>
<a id="Magnetic Disk"></a>
							<h3>Magnetic Disk</h3>
<br>
• Data can be accessed randomly from
magnetic disk.<br>
• Magnetic disk holds more data in small
place and attains faster data access.<br>
• It is a thin, circular metal plate / plotter
coated with magnetic material such as iron
oxide or ferrous oxide on the both side
which can be magnetized.<br>
• Data transfer rate higher than Tape system.<br>
• Very large amount of data can be stored in
a small space.<br>
• Erased and reused many times.<br>
• Cost is more expensive than tape system
<br>
	<a id="Optical Disk"></a>
							<h3>Optical Disk</h3>
<br>
• Uses optical storage techniques and
technology to read and write data.<br>
• Uses laser beams (transmitted from a laser
head mounted on an optical disk drive) to
read and write data.<br>
• Primarily used as a portable and secondary
storage device and has a relatively longer
lifespan.<br>
• Compact disks (CD-R, CD-R/W), digital
versatile/video disks (DVD-R, DVD-R/W)
and Blu-ray disks are currently the most
commonly used forms of optical disks.<br>
<a id="Blu-ray Disk"></a>
							<h3>Blu-ray Disk</h3>
<br>
Optical disks are generally used to:<br>
• Distribute software to customers<br>
• Store large amounts of data such as music, images and videos<br>
• Transfer data to different computers or devices<br>
• Back up data from a local machine<br>
▪ Use Blu-ray technology (blue-violet laser) is used to
read Blu-ray disks.<br>
▪ Compared to a DVD’s red laser, a blue laser permits
more information to be stored at a greater density.<br>
▪ DVD can store 15 GB per layer, a Blu-ray disk can
store 25 GB per layer, and dual-layer disks can hold
up to 50 GB.<br>

						<h3>How the CPU Uses Memory  </h3>
						⚫ Computer memory refers to the area where data and programs are
stored. Memory is not part of the CPU, but the CPU must interact
closely with it.<br>
⚫ There are two types of computer memory: primary, or main, and
secondary. The CPU relies heavily on main memory for storing
program instructions and the data on which the instructions operate
on. Main memory is temporary in nature and only holds instructions
and data for a program while the program is executing. Secondary
memory is the more permanent storage provided by hard drives and
flash drives.<br>
⚫ A component of the CPU known as the control unit is responsible for
moving instructions and data from secondary storage into main
memory prior to instruction execution. The control unit also moves
the results of an instruction to secondary storage.
How the computer uses the memory
How the CPU Uses Memory:<br>
Before an instruction can be executed,
program instructions and data must be
placed into memory from an input device
or a secondary storage device<br>
Once the necessary data and instruction
are in memory, the central processing unit
performs the following four steps for each
instruction:<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Steps"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> Steps </h3>
					<br>	1. The control unit fetches (gets) the instruction
from memory.<br>
2. The control unit decodes the instruction (decides
what it means) and directs that the necessary
data be moved from memory to the
arithmetic/logic unit. These first two steps
together are called instruction time, or I-time.<br>
3. The arithmetic/logic unit executes the arithmetic
or logical instruction. That is, the ALU is given
control and performs the actual operation on the
data.<br>
4. The ALU unit stores the result of this operation
in memory or in a register. Steps 3 and 4
together are called execution time, or E-time.
