		<h3> Elements of C </h3>
		
		<p>
		
		C Standards( ANSI C and C99)<br>
• Everything before standardization is generally called "K&R C”. This was "the C
language" from 1972-1989.<br>
• The first C standard was released 1989 nationally in USA, by ANSI. This release is
called C89 or ANSI-C. From 1989-1990 this was "the C language".<br>
• The year after, the American standard was accepted internationally and
published by ISO (ISO 9899:1990). This release is called C90. From 1990-1999,
C90 was "the C language".<br>
• A minor update was released in 1995, sometimes referred to as "C95". The main
change was introduction of wide character support.<br>
• In 1999, the C standard went through a major revision (ISO 9899:1999). This
version of the standard is called C99. From 1999-2011, this was "the C language".<br>
• In 2011, the C standard was changed again (ISO 9899:2011). This version is called
C11. The update had a lot of focus on multi-core, multi-processing and
expression sequencing. From 2011-2017, this was "the C language".<br>
• In 2017, C11 was revised and various defect reports were solved. This standard is
informally called C18 and was released as ISO 9899:2018. It contains no new
features, just corrections. It is the current version of the C language.<br>
			
			
			<h3>C Character Set (Alphabet of C Language):</h3><br> The characters that
constitute the C language. These character sets are:<br>
1. ENGLISH ALPHABETS(Letters)<br>
Uppercase letters A-Z<br>
Lowercase letters a-z<br>
2. DIGITS 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9<br>
3. SPECIAL CHARACTERS<br>
~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + = - / < | > ? \ . , ‘ “ : ; [ ] { }<br>
4. WHITE SPACES<br>
space bar , tab<br>
			
		<a id="Tokens"></a>	
			
		<h3>C Tokens :</h3>	 Tokens are basic building blocks of a language. C language
has following tokens.</h3>
		<h3>1. Keywords:</h3> are predefined, reserved words in C and each of which is
associated with specific features. These words help us to use the
functionality of C language. They have special meaning to the compilers .<br>
Elements of C<br>
auto double int struct<br>
break else long switch<br>
case enum register typedef<br>
char extern return union<br>
continue for signed void<br>
do if static while<br>
default goto sizeof volatile<br>
const float short unsigned<br>
			
			
		<h3>	2. Identifiers :</h3><br>
• Program elements those are used for naming of variables,
functions, array , user defined types etc are identifiers.<br>
• These are user-defined names which consist of alphabets,
number, underscore ‘_’.<br>
• Identifier’s name should not be same on the same scope.<br>
• Keywords cannot not be used as identifiers.<br>
• Below are the rules for naming C iden?fiers −<br>
– It must begin with letter or underscore.<br>
– Only letters, digits and underscore can be used, no other special
characters, punctuations are allowed.<br>
– It must not contain white-space.<br>
– It should not be a keyword.<br>
– It should be up to 31 characters long.<br>
• E.g. Valid identifier: x, a1, _xy, a_b , a12x etc,<br>
• Invalid: int, 1a, $usd, a.b etc.<br>
Elements of C (Tokens)<br>

			
			
		<h3>Operators: </h3>can be defined as symbols that help us to perform
specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.<br>
			
			
			
			
		<h3>Constants:</h3><br>
• A constant is a literal or data storage location used by our
program where a value can be stored but can't be changed
during program execution.<br>
• Constants in C may be numeric or character constants based
on their values<br>
• A constants in C can be divided as literal or symbolic
constants based on whether it is used directly literal value or
it is used as the given name in the program<br>
– E.g.<br>
#define PI 22/7 , here PI is symbolic which has given value 22/7
const int PI = 3.14; here PI is symbolic and 3.14 is literal

			<h3>More about Constants  </h3>
			<p>
			
			Integer Constants are sequences of digits. There are three types of integers
namely decimal ,octal and hexadecimal .<br>
The largest integer value that can be stored is machine-dependent. It is 32767
on 16 bit machine and 2,147,483,647 on 32-bit machine. But it is also possible
to store larger integer constants on these machines by appending qualifiers
such as U,L and UL to the constants.<br>
e.g.<br>
• 56789U or 56789u for unsigned integer<br>
• 987612347UL or 987612347ul for unsigned long integer.<br>
• 9876543L or 9876543l for long integer.<br>
• Real Constants are the numbers with fractional parts and optional leading
+ or – symbol.<br>
e.g. 0.9876 , -9.786 +98.765 etc which are in decimal notation.<br>
0.65e4 , 1.5e+5 -1.2E-1 etc. in scientific notations.<br>
• Single Character constants contains a single character enclosed within a
pair of single quote marks. Example: ‘c’ ‘%’ ‘&’ ‘7’ etc.<br>

<br>
• A String Constant is a sequence of characters enclosed
in double quotes. The characters may be letters,
numbers special characters and blank space.<br>
Example: “Well come”<br>
“a”<br>
“890”<br>
“*&^%$” etc.<br>
• In addition C supports some special backslash
character constants that are used in output functions
called escape sequences.<br>
• For example: ‘\n’ for newline, ‘\t’ for tab, ‘\b’ for back
space, ‘\”’ for double quote ‘\\’ for \ and so on.<br>


All the types of above constants can be classified in to two main
categories.

	<a id="Literal Constants"></a>			<br>
<h4> Literal Constants</h4> <br><h4> Symbolic Constants.</h4><br>
			<h3> Literal Constants</h3>
• A literal constant is a value that is typed directly into the
source code wherever it is needed.<br> Here are two examples:
int count = 20;<br>
float tax_rate = 0.28;<br>
• The 20 and the 0.28 are literal constants. The preceding
statements store these values in the variables count and
tax_rate.<br>
• Note that one of these constants contains a decimal point,
whereas the other does not.<br>
• The presence or absence of the decimal point distinguishes
floating-point constants from integer constants.<br>

• A constant starting with the digit 0 is interpreted as
an octal integer (the base-8 number system).<br>
• Octal constants can contain the digits 0 through 7
and a leading minus or plus sign.<br>
e.g. 065 034 etc.<br>
• A constant starting with 0x or 0X is interpreted as a
hexadecimal constant (the base-16 number system).<br>
• Hexadecimal constants can contain the digits 0
through 9, the letters A through F, and a leading
minus or plus sign.<br>
e.g. 0x9F 0X7C 0xAB etc.<br>

• A literal constant written with a decimal point is a
floating-point constant and is represented by the C
compiler as a double-precision number. Floating-point
constants can be written in standard decimal notation, as
shown in these examples:<br>
– 123.456 0.019 100.0<br>
• Floating-point constants also can be written in scientific
notation.<br>
• In C, scientific notation is written as a decimal number
followed immediately by an E or e and the exponent:<br>
Examples below-<br>
• 1.23E2 is 1.23 times 10 to the 2nd power, or 123<br>
• 4.08e6 4.08 times 10 to the 6th power, or 4,080,000<br>
• 0.85e-4 0.85 times 10 to the -4th power, or 0.000085<br>

			<h3> Symbolic Constants </h3>
			<p>
			
			A symbolic constant is a constant that is represented by a name (symbol) in a
program.<br>
• Whenever we need the constant's value in our program, we use its name.
• The actual value of the symbolic constant needs to be entered only once, when
it is first defined.<br>
• Symbolic constants have two significant advantages over literal constants, as the
following example shows. Suppose that we're writing a program that performs a
variety of geometrical calculations. The program frequently needs the value ,,
(3.14159) for its calculation. For example, to calculate the circumference and
area of a circle with a known radius, we could write<br>
– circumference = 3.14159 * (2 * radius);<br>
– area = 3.14159 * (radius)*(radius);<br>
• If, however, we define a symbolic constant with the name PI and the value 3.14,
we could write<br>
– circumference = PI * (2 * radius);<br>
– area = PI * (radius)*(radius);<br>
• If we have to change constant literal, just has to change at once in its
definitions.<br>

			5.Delimiters(special symbols):<br>
Delimiters are tokens which are symbols used as
a separator for variables, statements etc. for
writing program statements.<br> For example
comma(,)<br>
semicolon(;)<br>
Space<br>
		<a id="Scape Sequences"></a>	<br>	
				
				
			<h3>	Scape Sequences: </h3><br>The C languages support a concept called
Escape Sequence. When a character is preceded by a backslash
(\), it is called an escape sequence and it has a special meaning
to the compiler. For example, \n in the following statement is a
valid character and it is called a new line character<br>

					<br>	<h3>Elements of C</h3>

\t Inserts a tab in the text at this point.<br>
\b Inserts a backspace in the text at this point.<br>
\a Bell Character(Produce a beep sound)<br>
\n Inserts a newline in the text at this point.<br>
\r Inserts a carriage return in the text at this point.<br>
\f Inserts a form feed in the text at this point.<br>
\’ Inserts a single quote character in the text at this point.<br>
\” Inserts a double quote character in the text at this point.<br>
\\ Inserts a backslash character in the text at this point.<br>
\? Inserts a question mark characters in the text at this point.<br>
				
				
				
				<a id="Data Types"></a>
				
				
				
				<br>
				
				
			<h3>	Data Types:</h3>
A data type is the type of the value associated with a variable or
constant. C language supports following data types;<br>

						<h4> Primary(or fundamental) data types</h4>
<h4> Derived data types</h4>
<h4> User-defined data types</h4>
Primary Data types and associated variables :<br>
There are five basic data types in C associated with variables:
• int - integer: a whole number.<br>
• float - floating point value: i.e. a number with a fractional
part.<br>
• double - a double-precision floating point value.<br>
• char - a single character.<br>
• void – holds no value and used to specify the type of function
or what it returns.<a id="Derived Data Types"></a><br>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
				
				
				<br>
				
				
			<h3>Derived Data Types:</h3>	
• C supports three derived data types:<br>
<h4> Arrays:</h4> Arrays are sequences of data items
having homogeneous values. They have adjacent
memory locations to store values.<br>
<h4> Pointers:</h4> Pointers: These are powerful features which are
used to access the memory and deal with their
address.<br>
<h4>References:</h4>  Function pointers allow referencing
functions with a particular signatures.
						<a id="User Defined Data Types"></a>
						<br>
				
				
				
				
				
				
				<br>	
				
				
			<h3>User Defined Data Types.</h3>	
			
• C allows the feature called type definition which allows
programmers to define their identifier that would represent an
existing data type
				<br>
				
				
				
				<a id="Variable"
				></a>
				
				<br>	
			<h3>Variable:</h3>
• A variable is a named data storage location in the computer's
memory.<br>
• By using a variable's name in our program, we are, in effect,
referring to the data stored there.<br>
• A variable can have different values at different instant of time.
• Based of the value stored in variable, each variable is defined with
a data type associated with it.<br>
• The syntax of declaration of variable in C is:
– <data type><space><variable name>;<br>
• e.g. int x; Here int is data type and x is variable(identifier)<br>
– Similarly, float y; char ch; etc.<br>
int count, num, my_num; Multiple variable of same type.<br>
				
				
				
				
				
			<a id="Statements"></a>	
				
			<br>	
				
				
			<h3>Statements:</h3>	
• A statement is a complete direction instructing the computer
to carry out some task.<br>
• In C, statements are usually written one per line, although
some statements can span multiple lines.<br>
• C statements always end with a semicolon (except for
preprocessor directives such as #define and #include.<br>
• For example: x = 2 + 3; is an assignment statement. It
instructs the computer to add 2 and 3 and to assign the result
to the variable x.<br>
• printf(“C Programming”); - is a output statement that prints
the text string written in between “ ” as C Programming
<br><h3>Statements and White Space :</h3>
						

• The C compiler isn't sensitive to white space.<br>
• When the compiler reads a statement in the source code, it
ignores white space.<br>
• Thus, the statement x=2+3; is equivalent to this
statement: x = 2 + 3;<br>
• It is also equivalent to this:<br>
x =<br>
2<br>
+<br>
3;<br>
						<h4>Note:</h4>
 But Within literal string constants, tabs and spaces aren't
ignored; they are considered part of the string. For example in
“C Programming Language” the spaces also part of string
not ignored.<br>

• Literal string constants are strings that are enclosed within quotes
and interpreted literally by the compiler, space for space.<br>
• Although it's extremely bad form, the following is legal:<br>
printf(<br>
"Hello, world!"<br>
);<br>
• Below, however, is not legal:<br>
printf("Hello,<br>
world!");<br>
• To break a literal string constant line, we must use the backslash
character (\) just before the break.<br>
• Thus, the following is legal:<br>
printf("Hello,\<br>
world!");<br><script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

						<a id="Null Statements"></a>
<br>
						<h3>Null Statements</h3>

• If we place a semicolon by itself on a line, we create a null statement i.e. a
statement that doesn't perform any action. This is perfectly legal in C.<br>
e.g. the null statement is:       ;<br>
				<a id="Compound Statements"></a>		
				<br>
						<h3>Compound Statements</h3>

• A compound statement, also called a block, is a group of two or more C
statements enclosed in braces. Here's an example of a block:<br>
{<br>
printf("Hello, ");<br>
printf("world!");<br>
}<br>
• In C, a block can be used anywhere a single statement can be used. Note that
the enclosing braces can be positioned in different ways. The following is
equivalent to the preceding example:<br>
{printf("Hello, ");<br>
printf("world!");}<br>
• But it is recommended to use the braces {} at proper positions so that it's easy to find the
beginning and end of a block.<br>
• Don’t spread a single statement across multiple lines if there's no need to do so. Limit
statement to one line if possible.

<br>
						<h3>Expressions</h3>

• In C, an expression is anything that evaluates to a numeric value. C
expressions come in all levels of complexity.<br>
					<h4>Simple Expressions</h4>

• The simplest C expression consists of a single item: a simple variable,
literal constant, or symbolic constant. Here are four expressions:
Expression Description<br>
PI A symbolic constant (defined in the program)<br>
20 A literal constant<br>
rate A variable<br>
-1.25 Another literal constant<br>
• A literal constant evaluates to its own value.<br>
• A symbolic constant evaluates to the value it was given when we
created it using the #define directive or in const statement<br>
• A variable evaluates to the current value assigned to it by the program.
						
						<a id="Complex Expressions"></a>
<br>
						<h3>Complex Expressions</h3>

• Complex expressions consist of simpler expressions connected by operators. For
example: 2 + 8 is an expression consisting of the sub-expressions 2 and 8 and the
addition operator +. The expression 2 + 8 evaluates 10.<br>
• We can also write C expressions of great complexity:<br>
1.25 / 8 + 5 * rate + rate * rate / cost<br>
• Consider the following statement:<br>
x = a + 10;<br>
• This statement evaluates the expression a + 10 and assigns the result to variable x.<br>
• In addition, the entire statement x = a + 10 is itself an expression that evaluates to
the value of the variable on the left side of the equal sign.<br>
• Thus, we can write statements such as the following, which assigns the value of
the expression a + 10 to both variables, x and y as:<br>
y = x = a + 10; More Complex expressino<br>
• We can also write statements such as this:<br>
x = 6 + (y = 4 + 5);<br>
• All of these are complex expression.<br>

						<a id="Comments"></a>
<br>
						<h3>Comments</h3>

• Comments are those parts of the source code which are ignored by
compiler during compilation.<br>
• In C, comments are anything written between the characters /*
and */<br>
e.g. /* This is my First C Program */<br>
• If multiple lines comments are needed, we can use multiple
comments each per one line or multi-line single comment using
the same starting and ending characters
/*this is my first c program */<br>
/*this program prints a message hello */<br>
• Or equivalently these comments can be written as :<br>
/* this is my first c program<br>
this program prings a message hello<br>
*/<br>
<h3>The First C Program</h3>
