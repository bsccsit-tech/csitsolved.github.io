<h3>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous</h3>
<p>There are two types of sequential circuits: </p>
<p>Synchronous sequential circuit:</p>
<p>
It is a system whose behavior can be defined from the
knowledge of its signals at discrete instant of time.
Circuit output changes only at some discrete instants of
time.
This type of circuits achieves synchronization by using
a timing signal called the clock. 	
</p>
<p>
Asynchronous sequential circuit:	
</p>
<p>It is a system whose behavior depends in the order in
which its input signals change and can be affected at
any instant of time.
circuit output can change at any time (clock less).

<h3>Flip Flop </h3>
The memory elements used in clocked sequential circuits
are called flip-flops.
• These circuits are binary cells capable of storing one bit of
information.
• A flip-flop circuit has two outputs, one for the normal
value and one for the complement value of the bit stored in
it.
• A flip-flop circuit can maintain a binary state indefinitely
(as long as power is delivered to the circuit) until directed
by an input signal to switch states.
• The major differences among various types of flip-flops
are in the number of inputs they possess and in the manner
in which the inputs affect the binary state. 

</p>
	</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Basic flip-flop circuit (direct-coupled
RS flip-flop or SR latch)</h3>
<p>
	The SR latch is a circuit with two cross-coupled NOR gates or two crosscoupled NAND gates.
• Each flip-flop has two outputs, Q and Q', and two inputs, set and reset
• The cross-coupled connection from the output of one gate to the input of the
other gate constitutes a feedback path.
• For this reason, the circuits are classified as asynchronous sequential circuits. 
</p>
<p>
	A flip-flop has two useful states.
• Set state: When Q = 1 and Q' = 0, (or 1-state),
• Reset state: When Q = 0 and Q' = 1, (or 0-state)
• Output of a NOR gate is 0 if any input is 1, and that the output is 1 only when
all inputs are 0.
• First, assume that the set input is 1 and the reset input is 0. Since gate-2 has
an input of 1, its output Q' must be 0, which puts both inputs of gate-1 at 0, so
that output Q is 1. When the set input is returned to 0, the outputs remain the
same i.e. output Q' stay at 0, which leaves both inputs of gate-1 at 0, so that
output Q is 1.
• Similarly, 1 in the reset input changes output Q to 0 and Q' to 1. When the
reset input returns to 0, the outputs do not change.
• When a 1 is applied to both the set and the reset inputs, both Q and Q' outputs
go to 0. This condition violates the fact that outputs Q and Q' are the
complements of each other.

<h3>Basic flip-flop circuit: SR Latch with
NAND Gates</h3>
The NAND basic flip-flop circuit operates with both inputs
normally at 1 unless the state of the flip-flop has to be
changed.
• The application of a momentary 0 to the set input causes
output Q to go to 1 and Q' to go to 0, thus putting the flipflop into the set state
• After the set input returns to 1, a momentary 0 to the reset
input causes a transition to the clear state.
• When both inputs go to 0, both outputs go to 1- a condition
avoided in normal flip-flop operation.

</p>
<p>
	</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<h3>SR Latch with Control Input</h3>
The operation of the basic SR latch can be modified by
providing an additional control input that determines when
the state of the latch can be changed.
• In Fig., it consists of the basic SR latch and two additional
NAND gates. 

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Clocked RS Flip-Flop: NOR gate</h3>
It consists of a basic flip-flop circuit and two additional
AND gates along with clock pulse (CP) input.
• The pulse input acts as an enable signal for the other two
inputs.

<h3>Clocked RS Flip-Flop: NAND gate</h3>
It consists of a basic flip-flop circuit and two additional
NAND gates along with clock pulse (CP) input.
• The pulse input acts as an enable signal for the other two
inputs.

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Clocked RS Flip-Flop</h3>
<p>
	When the pulse input goes to 1, information from the S or R input is
allowed to reach the output.
• Set state: S = 1, R = 0, and CP = 1.
• Reset state: S = 0, R = 1, and CP = 1.
• In either case, when CP returns to 0, the circuit remains in its previous
state.
• When CP = 1 and both the S and R inputs are equal to 0, the state of
the circuit does not change. 
</p>
<p>
	Characteristic equation
</p>
<p>
	The characteristic equation of the flip-flop
specifies the value of the next state as a function
of the present state and the inputs. 
</p>
<p>
	Graphic symbol
</p>
<p>
	The graphic symbol of the RS
flip-flop consists of a
rectangular-shape block with
inputs S, R, and C. The
outputs are Q and Q', where
Q' is the complement of Q
(except in the indeterminate
state). 

</p>
</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Clocked JK Flip-Flop</h3>
<p>
	A JK flip-flop is a refinement of the RS flip-flop in that the
indeterminate state of the RS type is defined in the JK type.
• Inputs J and K behave like inputs S and R to set and clear
the flip-flop, respectively.
• The input marked J is for set and the input marked K is for
reset.
• When both inputs J and K are equal to 1, the flip-flop
switches to its complement state, that is, if Q = 1, it
switches to Q = 0, and vice versa.
• A JK flip-flop constructed with two cross-coupled NOR
gates and two AND gates
</p>
<p>
	A JK flip-flop constructed with two cross-coupled NOR
gates and two AND gates.
• Output Q is ANDed with K and CP inputs so that the flipflop is cleared during a clock pulse only if Q was
previously 1.
• Similarly, output Q' is ANDed with J and CP inputs so that
the flop-flop is set with a clock pulse only when Q' was
previously 1.
• Because of the feedback connection in the JK flipflop, a
CP pulse that remains in the 1 state while both J and K are
equal to 1 will cause the output to complement again and
repeat complementing until the pulse goes back to 0.

<h3>Clocked JK Flip-Flop: Race around
condition</h3>
If the inputs of JK flip Flop are J=K=1 and Q=0 and clock pulse
as shown in fig., After a time interval tp equal to propagation
delay of NAND gates, the output will change to Q=1.Now we
have J=1,K=1 and Q=1.If duration of clock pulse(T) is greater
than propagation delay tp
, after another time interval of tp
 the
output will change back to Q=0,hence the output will oscillate
back and forth between 0 and 1.The output is uncertain at the
end of clock pulse if flip flop is level trigger. This situation is
called race around condition.
• The race around condition can be avoided if clock pulse is
reduced than the propagation delay of the flip flop t<sup>p</sup> greather than  T but this
is not practically feasible.
• A more practical method for this is use of master slave flip flop
or edge triggered JK flip flop. 

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3> D Flip-Flop</h3>
One way to eliminate the undesirable condition of the
indeterminate state in the RS flip-flop is to ensure that
inputs S and R are never equal to 1 at the same time.
– This is done in the D flip-flop
• The D flip-flop has only two inputs: D and CP.
• The D input goes directly to the S input and its
complement is applied to the R input.
• As long as CP is 0, the circuit cannot change state
regardless of the value of D.
• The D input is sampled when CP = 1.
 If D is 1, the Q output goes to 1, placing the circuit in the set state.
 If D is 0, output Q goes to 0 and the circuit switches to
the clear state. 

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>T Flip-Flop</h3>
The T flip-flop is a single-input version of the JK flip-flop
and is obtained from the JK flip-flop when both inputs are
tied together.
• The designation T comes from the ability of the flip-flop to
"toggle," or complement, its state.
• Regardless of the present state, the flip-flop complements
its output when the clock pulse occurs while input T is 1.
• The characteristic table and characteristic equation show
that:
– When T = 0, Q(t + 1) = Q, that is, the next state is the
same as the present state and no change occurs.
– When T = 1, then Q (t + 1) = Q', and the state of the
flip-flop is complemented. 

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Master-Slave Flip-Flop</h3>
A master-slave flip-flop is constructed from two
separate flip-flops.
o One circuit serves as a master and the other as a slave,
and the overall circuit is referred to as a master slave
flip-flop.

<h3>RS Master-Slave Flip-flop </h3>
It consists of a master flip-flop, a slave flip-flop, and an inverter.
• When clock pulse CP is 0, the output of the inverter is 1.
• Since the clock input of the slave is 1, the flip-flop is enabled and output
Q is equal to Y, while Q' is equal to Y'.
• The master flip-flop is disabled because CP = 0.
• When the pulse becomes 1, the information then at the external R and S
inputs is transmitted to the master flip-flop. The slave flip-flop, however,
is isolated as long as the pulse is at its 1 level, because the output of the
inverter is 0.
• When the pulse returns to 0, the master flip-flop is isolated; this prevents
the external inputs from affecting it. The slave flip-flop then goes to the
same state as the master flip-flop. 

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>JK Master-slave Flip-Flop </h3>
Master-slave JK flip-flop constructed with
NAND gates is shown in Fig.
• It consists of two flip-flops; the master flip-flop,
and the slave flip-flop.
• The information present at the J and K inputs is
transmitted to the master flip-flop on the positive
edge of a clock pulse and is held there until the
negative edge of the clock pulse occurs, after
which it is allowed to pass through to the slave
flip-flop.
<p>
	Operation:
</p>
<p>
• The clock input is normally 0, which prevents the J and K
inputs from affecting the master flip-flop.
• The slave flip-flop is a clocked RS type, with the master flipflop supplying the inputs and the clock input being inverted by
NOT gate
• When the clock is 0, Q = Y, and Q' = Y'.
• When the positive edge of a clock pulse occurs, the master
flip-flop is affected and may switch states.
• The slave flip-flop is isolated as long as the clock is at the 1
level
• When the clock input returns to 0, the master flip-flop is
isolated from the J and K inputs and the slave flip-flop goes to
the same state as the master flip-flop. 

</p>
</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Triggering of Flip Flop</h3>
The state of a flip-flop is switched by a momentary change in the input
signal. This momentary change is called a trigger.
• Clocked flip-flops are triggered by pulses.
• A pulse starts from an initial value of 0, goes momentarily to 1, and
after a short time, returns to its initial 0 value.
• A clock signal is a periodic square wave that indefinitely switches
values from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 at fixed intervals.
• A clock pulse may be either positive or negative.
– A positive clock source remains at o during the interval between
pulses and goes to 1 during the occurrence of a pulse.
<p>
	• An edge triggered flip flop changes state either at positive
edge(rising edge) or at negative edge(falling edge) of the
clock pulse and is sensitive to its input only at this
transition of the clock.
• A pulse triggered flip flop changes state either at the
positive pulse (positive level of the pulse) or at negative
pulse(negative level of pulse)of the applied clock pulse.

<h3>
Edge-Triggered Flip-Flop 
</h3>
Edge-triggered flip-flop (alternative to master-slave) synchronizes the
state changes during clock-pulse transitions.
• In this type of flip-flop, output transitions occur at a specific level of the
clock pulse.
• When the pulse input level exceeds this threshold level, the inputs are
locked out and the flip-flop is therefore unresponsive to further changes in
inputs until the clock pulse returns to 0 and another pulse occurs.
• Some edge-triggered flip-flops cause a transition on the positive edge of
the pulse, and others cause a transition on the negative edge of the pulse.
• The logic diagram of a D-type positive-edge-triggered flip-flop is shown
below.
• It consists of three basic flip-flops. NAND gates 1 and 2 make up one
basic flip-flop and gates 3 and 4 another. The third basic flip-flop
comprising gates 5 and 6 provides the outputs to the circuit. Inputs S and
R of the third basic flip-flop must be maintained at logic-1 for the outputs
to remain in their steady state values.
<p>
When S = 0 and R = 1, the output goes to the set
state with Q = 1.
• When S = 1 and R = 0, the output goes to the clear
state with Q = 0.
• Inputs S and R are determined from the states of
the other two basic flip-flops. These two basic
flip-flops respond to the external inputs D (data)
and CP (clock pulse). 	
</p>
<p>
	The binary values at the outputs of the four gates when
CP = 0. Input D may be equal to 0 or 1. In either case, a CP of 0 causes
the outputs of gates 2 and 3 to go to 1, thus making S = R = 1, which is
the condition for a steady state output. 
</p>
<p>
	When CP = 1
– If D = 1 then S changes to 0, but R remains at 1, which
causes the output of the flip-flop Q to go to 1 (set state).
– If D = 0 then S = 1 and R = 0. Flip-flop goes to clear
state (Q = 0). 

</p>
</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">

<p>
<h3>
Direct Inputs 
</h3>
Flip-flops available in IC packages sometimes provide special inputs
for setting or clearing the flip-flop asynchronously.
• These inputs are usually called direct preset and direct clear. They
affect the flip-flop on a positive (or negative) value of the input signal
without the need for a clock pulse.
• These inputs are useful for bringing all flip-flops to an initial state prior
to their clocked operation.
• Example: After power is turned on in a digital system, the states of its
flip-flops are indeterminate.
• A clear switch clears all the flip-flops to an initial cleared state and a
start switch begins the system's clocked operation. The clear switch
must clear all flip-flops asynchronously without the need for a pulse.

<h3>
Analysis of Clocked Sequential Circuit
</h3>
The behavior of a clocked sequential circuit is
determined from its inputs, outputs and state of the
flip-flops (i.e., the output of the flip-flops).
• The analysis of a clocked sequential circuit
consists of obtaining a table of a diagram of the
time sequences of inputs, outputs and states.
– E.g., given a current state and current inputs, how will
the state and outputs change when the next active clock
edge arrives??? 

<p>
	We have a basic procedure for analyzing a clocked
sequential circuit:
Write down the equations for the outputs and the flipflop inputs.
Using these equations, derive a state table which
describes the next state.
Obtain a state diagram from the state table.
• It is the state table and/or state diagram that specifies the
behavior of the circuit.
• The flip-flop input equations are sometimes called the
excitation equations.
• The state table is sometimes called a transition table. 
	
</p>
</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">

<p>
<h3>
State Equations
</h3>
A state equation is an algebraic expression that specifies the condition
for a flip-flop state transition.
• The left side of the equation denotes the next state of the flip-flop and
the right side of the equation is a Boolean expression that specifies the
present state and input conditions that make the next state equal to 1.
• In above example, D inputs determine the flip-flop’s next state, so it
is possible to write a set of next-state equations for the circuit:
 A(t + 1) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)x(t)
 B(t + 1) = A '(t)x(t)
• In compact form:
 A(t + 1) = Ax + Bx
 B(t + 1) = A'x
• Similarly, the present-state value of the output y can be expressed
algebraically as : y(t) = [A(t) + B(t)]x'(t)
• Removing the symbol (t) for the present state, the output Boolean
function: y = (A + B)x' 

</p>

</div>	<div class="courses_row">


<p>
<h3>
State table 
</h3>
The time sequence of inputs, outputs, and flip-flop states can be
enumerated in a state table.
• The state table for the example circuit.

<p>
	The table consists of four sections:
Present state: shows the states of flipflops A and B at any given time t
Input: gives a value of x for each
possible present state
Next state: shows the states of the flipflops one clock period later at
time t + 1.
Output: gives the value of y for each
present state.
Next state and output column is derived
from the state equations.
	
</p>
</p>

</div>	<div class="courses_row">


<p>
<h3>
State Diagram
</h3>
The information available in a state table can be represented
graphically in a state diagram.
• In this diagram, a state is represented by a circle, and the transition
between states is indicated by directed lines connecting the circles.
• Each directed line is labeled ‘inputs/outputs’.

<h3>
State Reduction and Assignment 
</h3>
<p>
<h3>State Reduction </h3>
</p>
<p>
	The reduction of the number of flip-flops in a sequential circuit is
referred to as the state-reduction problem.
• State-reduction, reducing the number of states in a state table, while
keeping the external input–output requirements unchanged, can reduce
the number of flip-flops used in a sequential circuit.
• Since m flip-flops produce 2m states, a reduction in the number of
states may (or may not)result in a reduction in the number of flipflops.
• Reducing the number of flip-flops sometimes results the equivalent
circuit with fewer flip-flops but more combinational gates to realize its
next state and output fewer flip flops but more combinational gates to
realize its next state and output logic.

<h3>State Reduction Example </h3>
</p>
<p>
	Two circuits are equivalent if
identical input sequences are
applied to the two circuits and
identical outputs occur for all
input sequences, then one may
be replaced by the other.
• State reduction reduces the
number of states in a sequential
circuit without altering the
input–output relationships.
• Only the input-output
sequences are important in this
example.
• Consider the input sequence
01010110100 starting from the
initial state a 
	<p>
		State table is more convenient for state reduction than a diagram.
• State reduction algorithm: “Two states are said to be equivalent if, for each
member of the set of inputs, they give exactly the same output and send
the circuit either to the same state or to an equivalent state.”
• When two states are equivalent, one of them can be removed without
altering the input–output relationships.

<h3>
State Assignment 
</h3>
The cost of the combinational-circuit part of a sequential
circuit can be reduced by using the known simplification
methods for combinational circuits.
• However, there is another factor, known as the stateassignment problem that comes into play in minimizing the
combinational gates.
• State-assignment procedures are concerned with methods for
assigning binary values to states in such a way as to reduce
the cost of the combinational circuit that drives the flip-flops.
• States must be assigned with unique coded binary values to
implement the physical components.
• The simplest way to code states is to use binary counting code
or Gray code without guaranteeing a better result. 
<p>
</p>
A different assignment will result in a state table with different binary
values for the states.
• The binary form of the state table is used to derive the next state and
output-forming combinational logic part of the sequential circuit.
• The complexity of the combinational circuit depends on the binary
state assignment chosen.
• Sometimes, the name transition table is used for a state table with a
binary assignment.

<h3>
 Design Procedure of Sequential Circuit 
</h3>
A synchronous sequential circuit is made up of flip-flops and
combinational gates.
• The design of the circuit consists of choosing the flip-flops and then
finding a combinational gate structure that, together with the flip-flops,
produces a circuit which fulfills the stated specifications.
• The design steps for synchronous sequential circuits can be summarized
as:
1. From the word description and specifications of the desired operation, derive a
state diagram for the circuit.
2. Obtain the State table
3. Reduce the number of states if necessary.
4. Assign binary values to the states.
5. Determine the number of flip-flops needed and assign a letter symbol to each.
6. Choose the type of flip-flops to be used
7. From the state table, derive the circuit excitation and output tables.
8. Derive the simplified flip-flop input equations and output equations.
9. Draw the logic diagram

<h3>
Design Example 
</h3>
The state diagram consists of four
states with binary values already
assigned.
• Directed lines contain single binary
digit without a slash, we conclude
that there is one input variable and
no output variables. (The state of the
flip-flops may be considered the
outputs of the circuit).
• The two flip-flops needed to
represent the four states are
designated A and B.
• The input variable is designated x.

<h3>
Difference between synchronous and
asynchronous circuit 
</h3>
The behavior of a synchronous sequential circuit can be defined from
the knowledge of its signals at discrete instants of time.
• The behavior of an asynchronous sequential circuit depends upon the
input signals at any instant of time and the order in which the inputs
change signals at any instant of time and the order in which the inputs
change.
• The storage elements commonly used in asynchronous sequential
circuits are time-delay devices. Thus, an asynchronous sequential
circuit may be regarded as a combinational circuit with feedback (no
actual storage elements used).
• Asynchronous sequential circuit may become unstable at times,
imposing many difficulties on the designer.

<h3>
Latch and Flip Flops 
</h3>
The primary difference between a flip-flop and latch is the EN/CLOCK
input.
The flip-flop’s CLOCK input is edge sensitive, meaning the flip-flop’s
output changes on the edge (rising or falling) of the CLOCK input.
The latch’s EN input is level sensitive, meaning the latch’s output changes
on the level (high or low) of the EN input.
