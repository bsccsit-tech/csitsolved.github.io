			<h3>Problem Solving with Computer</h3><br>
				<p>
				
				A computer is a tool to solve a problem.
• Problem solving is the process of transforming the
description of a problem into a solution by using our
knowledge of the problem domain and by relying on
our ability to select and use appropriate problem-
solving strategies, techniques and tools.
• Programming is a problem solving activity. When we
write a program, we are actually writing instructions
for the computer to solve something for us.
• Using a computer as a problem solving tool following
steps are involved
Steps involved in Problem Solving with a Computer<br>
• Problem Definition<br>
• Problem Analysis<br>
• Program Design<br>
• Coding<br>
• Compilation and Execution<br>
• Debugging and Testing<br>
• Documentation<br>
				<a id="Problem Definition"></a>
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="courses_row">
				
			<h3>Problem Definition</h3>
			<p>
				A clearly defined problem is already half the
solution.
• Computer programming requires us to define
the problem first before we even try to create
a solution.
• Based on the clear definition, one can proceed
to design and write the program to solve any
problem.

		<a id="Problem Analysis"></a>	
		<div class="courses_row">
			
			<h3>Problem Analysis</h3>
			<p>
			Analyzing the problem require us to identify
the following:<p>
– Input(s) to the problem, their form and the input
media to be used<br>
– Output(s) expected from the problem, their form
and the output media to be used<br>
– Special constraints or conditions (if any)
– Any formulas or equations to be used</p>
			</p>
			</div>
			<a id="Program Design"></a>
	<div class="courses_row">
		<h3>Program Design</h3>
		<p>
		This process involve in preparing the algorithms to
the problem.<br>
• Algorithm :<br>An algorithm is a clear and
unambiguous specification of the steps needed
to solve a problem.<br>
• Algorithm may be expressed as in either form,<br>
1. Human language (e.g. English)<br>
2. Pseudocode<br>
3. Graphical Representation (Flow-Chart)<br>
		</p>
		</div>
		<a id="Algorithm Representation"></a>
	<div class="courses_row">
		<h3> Algorithm Representation: Pseudocode  </h3>
		<p>
		<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
		 is a cross between human language
and a programming language.<br>
		
		A pseudocode is:<br>
– An artificial and informal language that helps
programmers to develop algorithms<br>
– Not an actual programming language<br>
– Not actually executed on computers<br>
• Why do we need Pseudocode?<br>
– Helps to “think out” a program before writing it<br>
– May be converted easily into a corresponding<br>
programming language code.

		<div class="courses_row">
		<h3> Algorithm Example  </h3>
		<p>
		Problem: Compute the average marks of students
obtained in a TEST of "Computer Programming"<br>
• Human Language Specification: (In English)<br>
1. Read the no of students<br>
2. Read the marks of each students<br>
3. Sum the marks of all students as total marks.<br>
4. Divide the total marks by number of students.<br>
5. Report the result of division as average marks of students.<br>
• Pseudocode Specification:<br>
1. Input N<br>
2. Input N marks: m1,m2,m3,..... m N<br>
3. T =(m1+ m2+m3+... ... ....+ m N )/N<br>
4. A=T/N<br>
5. Output A<br>

	<a id="Flow Chart"></a>
				<div class="courses_row">
		<h3>Flow Chart   </h3>
		<p>
		
		A flow-chart is:<br>
• the graphical representation of the algorithm
for any problem.<br>
• useful for developing and representing
algorithms.<br>
• is drawn using certain special-purpose symbols
connected by arrows called flowlines.<br>
• The symbols indicate the actions to be
performed, and flowlines indicate the order in
which actions are to be performed<br>
		</p>
		</div>
	<a id="Coding"></a>
				<div class="courses_row">
		<h3>  Coding </h3>
		<p>
		 Coding is the real job of programmer.<br>
• The algorithm to solve a problem which is
described by pseudo-code or flow chart is
converted into actual programming language
code.<br>
• The code written by programmer by using any
programming language like C is called the
source code or source program.<br>
		
		</p>
		</div>
	<a id="Compiling/Linking"></a>
				<div class="courses_row">
		<h3>Compiling/Linking   </h3>
		<p>
		
		Compiler: A program that translates a program
written in source language (SourceCode) into the
equivalent target code.<br>
• Linker: A program that links the compiler generated
intermediate code with required necessary library
files.<br>
• Loader: A loader is the program that is used to load
the executable program instructions into memory
for execution<br>
• Integrated Development Environment(IDE): The IDE
is the program that allows to write source code ,
compile the source code as well as link and execute
the program from the single interface.
		</p>
		</div>
	<a id="Compilation and execution"></a>
				<div class="courses_row">
		<h3> Compilation and execution  </h3>
		<p>
		
		The source code written in any programming
language is not directly executed by the computer.<br>
• It should be translated into to the machine
readable format i.e. actual machine language. The
process of translation of source code into the
target code is called the compilation.<br>
• Each programming language has its own compiler
program that translates the source code into its
target code.<br>
• The converted program in actual machine
language is then executed by the computer which
is known as program execution.<br>
		</p>
		</div>

	<a id="Debugging and Testing"></a>
				<div class="courses_row">
		<h3> Debugging and Testing  </h3>
		<p>
		
		 A written program may have errors, some errors can be
detected by the language compilers and some errors can
not be identified by the compiler and occurred during
the program execution.<br>
• Common types of errors are:<br>
– Syntax Errors: Identified by compiler at the program
compilation time, easily detected and corrected.<br>
– Logical Errors: Not identified by the compiler at compile
time and identified at the execution time. e.g. misuse of
operators. Detected during program execution<br>
– Linker Errors: Errors detected during linking the compiled
code with necessary libraries. Detected by Linker.<br>
– Runtime Errors: Detected during program executions. These
are basically logical errors and also the errors related to
memory allocations.<br>
			
		<br>	Testing is the process of checking the program
for its correct functionality by executing the
program with some input data set and
observing the output of the program.<br>
• Testing may be:<br>
– Black Box Testing: <br>Just give input test data and
view the output which is correct or not as
expected(user level testing)<br>
– White Box Testing: <br>Detail debugging of code for
testing the correctness of the program(Programar
level testing)<br>
		</p>
		</div>
	<a id="Documentation"></a>
				<div class="courses_row">
		<h3>  Documentation </h3>
		<p>
	<br>	Documentation is the task of keeping all the references of the related
program for future references.<br>
• From the start of the problem solving to the end of the
implementation of the program, all the tasks should be documented
i.e. kept for future references.<br>
• Documentation is also the important part of the problem solving or
program development.<br>
• Documentation may be of two types<br>

– Technical Documentation: known as programmer's documentations
which includes the problem analysis to implementation details for that
program. It is needed for future reference for any modification, update
of the program.( Internal comments and External reference document)<br>
– User manual: is the documentation prepared for the end-user of the
program that guides the user how to operate the program.

		<h3>  Programming Languages </h3>
		<p>
		High Level Language:<br> Easy understandable by human
and closer to human language, and mostly used for
writing the programs e.g. C, C++, JAVA,FORTRAN etc.<br>
• Assembly Language: An assembly language is a low-
level programming language designed for a specific
type of processor. It may be produced by compiling
source code from a high-level
programming language (such as C/C++) but can also be
written from scratch.<br>
• Machine Language: Machine language, or machine
code, is a low-level language comprised of binary digits
(ones and zeros). It is understandable by machine
processor.<br>

	<a id="History of C"></a>
				<div class="courses_row">
		<h3>  History of C </h3>
		<p>
		
		C is a general-purpose computer programming language
developed between 1969 and 1973 by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell
Telephone Laboratories for use with the Unix operating system.<br>
• According to Ritchie, the most creative period occurred in 1972.<br>
• It was named "C" because its features were derived from an
earlier language called “B” at Bell Lab.<br>
• Although C was designed for implementing system software, it is
also widely used for developing portable application software.<br>
• In 1978, Brain Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first
edition of The C Programming Language.<br>
• The specification of C language referred in this book was called
by C programmer as “K&R”, and followed for long times.<br>
• The second edition of the book covers the later ANSI C standard.

	<a id="Structure of C program"></a>
				<div class="courses_row">
		<h3> Structure of C program  </h3>
		<p>
		
		The general form of a C program is as follows :<br>
• Preprocessor directives - Starting with symbol #<br>
• Global declarations of user functions<br>
• Global variables declarations<br>
• main()<br>
• {<br>
– local variables to function main ;<br>
– statements associated with function main ;<br>
• }<br>
• definitions of functions like<br>
– function1()<br>
– {<br>
• local variables to function 1 ;<br>
• statements associated with function 1 ;<br>
– }<br>
– function2()<br>
– {<br>
• local variables to function f2 ;<br>
• statements associated with function 2 ;<br>
– }<br>
...etc<br>
