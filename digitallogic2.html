<h3>Integrated Circuits</h3>
Integrated circuit (also called a chip) A piece of silicon on
which many gates have been embedded
• An Integrated circuit is an association (or connection) of various
electronic devices such as resistors, capacitors and transistors
etched (or fabricated) to a semiconductor material such as
silicon or germanium.
• It is also called as a chip or microchip.
• An IC can function as an amplifier, rectifier, oscillator, counter,
timer and memory.
<h3>Analog or Linear ICs:
</h3>
 They produce continuous output depending on the input signal.
 From the name of the IC we can deduce that the output is a
linear function of the input signal.
 When the input and output relationship of a circuit is linear,
linear IC is used.
 Input and output can take place on a continuous range of values
 Op-amp (operational amplifier) is one of the types of linear ICs
which are used in amplifiers, timers and counters, oscillators
etc.
<h3> Digital ICs:</h3>
Unlike Analog ICs, Digital ICs never give a continuous
output signal. Instead it operates only during defined
states.
 When the circuit is either in ON state or OFF state and not
in between the two, the circuit is called digital circuit and
the IC used in such circuit is called digital IC.
 Digital ICs are used mostly in microprocessor and various
memory applications.
 Logic gates are the building blocks of Digital ICs which
operate either at 0 or 1.

<h3>IC-Levels of Integration</h3>
SSI (small-scale integration): Up to 100 electronic
components per chip
• MSI (medium-scale integration): From 100 to 3,000
electronic components per chip
• LSI (large-scale integration): From 3,000 to 100,000
electronic components per chip
• VLSI (very large-scale integration): From 100,000 to
1,000,000 electronic components per chi
• ULSI (ultra large-scale integration): More than 1 million
electronic components per chip
</p>
	</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>SIP (Single In-line Package)</h3>
A single in-line package is an electronic device package
which has one row of connection pins.
• It is not as popular as the dual in-line package (DIP) which
contains two rows of pins, but has been used for packaging
RAM chips and multiple resistors with a common pin.
• SIPs group RAM chips together on a small board.
• The board itself has a single row of pin-leads that resembles a
comb extending from its bottom edge, which plug into a
special socket on a system or system-expansion board.
• SIPs are commonly found in memory modules.
</p><!-- Course -->
	</div>	<div class="courses_row">		
	<p>
<h3>Dual in-line package (DIP)</h3>
Dual in-line package (DIP) is a type of semiconductor
component packaging.
• It is an electronic device package with a rectangular housing and
two parallel rows of electrical connecting pins.
• DIPs can be installed either in sockets or permanently soldered
into holes extending into the surface of the printed circuit board.
• DIP is relatively broadly defined as any rectangular package
with two uniformly spaced parallel rows of pins pointing
downward, whether it contains an IC chip or some other
device(s), and whether the pins emerge from the sides of the
package and bend downwards.
• A DIP is usually referred to as
a DIPn, where n is the total
number of pins.
Eg IC 741 is DIP8

<h3>SIMM (Single In-line Memory
Module)</h3>

SIMM has a single line of connector.
• In a SIMM pins on opposite sides of board are tied together to form
one electrical path.
• Short for Single In-line Memory Module, SIMM is a circuit board
that holds six to nine memory chips per board, the ninth chip
usually an error checking chip (parity/non parity) and were
commonly used with Intel Pentium or Pentium compatible
motherboards.
• SIMMs are rarely used today and have been widely replaced by
DIMMs.
• SIMM ha 32 bit data path
• SIMMs are available in two flavors: 30 pin and 72 pin.
• 30-pin SIMMs are the older standard, and were popular on third
and fourth generation motherboards.
• 72-pin SIMMs are used on fourth, fifth and sixth generation PCs.

</p>
	</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>DIMM (Dual In-line Memory Module)</h3>
DIMM has two lines of connectors.
• Short for Dual In-line Memory Module, DIMM is a circuit
board that holds memory chips.
• In a DIMM opposite pins remain electrically isolated to form
two separate contact.
• DIMMs have a 64-bit data path because of the Pentium
Processor requirements.
• Because of the new bit path, DIMMs can be installed one at a
time, unlike SIMMs on a Pentium that would require two to be
added
• SO-DIMM is short for Small Outline DIMM and is available
as a 72-pin and 144-pin configuration.
• SO-DIMMs are commonly utilized in laptop computers.Advantages DIMMs have over SIMMs:
• DIMMs have separate contacts on each side of the board,
thereby providing twice as much data as a single SIMM.
• The command address and control signals are buffered on
the DIMMs. With heavy memory requirements this will
reduce the loading effort of the memory.

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Register Transistor Logic(RTL)</h3>
As its name suggests, RTL circuits mainly consists of
resistors and transistors that comprises RTL devices.
• Inputs to the NOR gate shown above are ‘input1’ &
‘input2’. The inputs applied at these terminals represent
either logic level HIGH (1) or LOW (0).
• The logic level LOW is the voltage that drives
corresponding transistor in cut-off region, while logic level
HIGH drives it into saturation region.
• If both the inputs are LOW, then both the transistors are in
cut-off i.e. they are turned-off. Thus, voltage Vcc appears
at output I.e. HIGH.
• If either transistor or both of them are applied HIGH input,
the voltage Vcc drops across Rc and output is LOW.

<h3>TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic)</h3>
The TTL family evolved from a previous technology that
used diodes and transistors for the basic NAND gate.
• This technology was called DTL for diode-transistor logic.
• Later the diodes were replaced by transistors to improve
the circuit operation and the name of the logic family was
changed to TTL.
• It has come to existence so as to overcome the speed
limitations of DTL family.
• The basic gate of this family is TTL NAND gate.

</p>
</div>
	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>MOS (Metal-Oxide Semiconductor)</h3>
The metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) is a unipolar
transistor that depends upon the flow of only one type of
carrier, which may be electrons (n-channel) or holes (p-
channel), this is in contrast to the bipolar transistor used in
TTL and ECL gates, where both carriers exist during
normal operation.
• A p-channel MOS is referred to as PMOS and an n-
channel as NMOS.
• NMOS is the one that is commonly used in circuits with
only one type of MOS transistor.

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide
Semiconductor)</h3>
 Complementary MOS (CMOS) technology uses one
PMOS and one NMOS transistor connected in a
complementary fashion in all circuits.
• The most important advantages of MOS over bipolar
transistors are the high packing density of circuits, a
simpler processing technique during fabrication, and a
more economical operation because of the low power
consumption.
• The main advantage of this is low static power
consumption and noise immunity.
• High operating speed.

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>IIL (Integrated Injection Logic)</h3>
Integrated injection logic (IIL, I 2 L, or I2L) is a class of
digital circuit technology built with multiple collector
bipolar junction transistors (BJT).
• When introduced it had speed comparable to TTL yet was
almost as low power as CMOS, making it ideal for use in
VLSI (and larger) integrated circuits. Although the logic
voltage levels are very close (High: 0.7V,Low: 0.2V),
• I 2 L has high noise immunity because it operates by current
instead of voltage.
• Sometimes also known as Merged Transistor Logic.

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Positive and Negative Logic</h3>
The binary signal at the inputs and outputs of any gate has
one of two values, except during transition.
• One signal value represents logic-1 and the other logic-0.
• Choosing the high-level H to represent logic-1 defines a
positive logic system.
• Choosing the low-level L to represent logic-1 defines a
negative logic system.

</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Characteristics of digital logic families</h3>
Fan-in
• Propagation delay
• Fan-out
• Power dissipation
• Noise margin

	<p>
<h3>Fan-in</h3></p>
For high-speed technologies, fan-in, the number of inputs to a gate,
is often restricted on gate primitives to no more than four or five.
• The maximum umber of inputs that can be applied to a logic gate.
• This is primarily due to electronic considerations related to gate
speed.
• To build gates with larger fan-in, interconnected gates with lower
fan-in are used during technology mapping.
• A mapping for a 7-input NAND gate is made up of two 4- input
NAND and an inverter as shown in figure.
</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Propagation delay</h3>
The signals through a gate take a certain amount of time to
propagate from the inputs to the output. This interval of
time is defined as the propagation delay of the gate.
• Propagation delay is measured in nanoseconds (ns).
• The signals that travel from the inputs of a digital circuit to
its outputs pass through a series of gates.
• The sum of the propagation delays through the gates is the
total delay of the circuit.

<h3>Fan-out</h3>
Fan-out specifies the number of standard loads driven by a
gate output
• Fan-out is a measure of the ability of a logic gate output to
drive a number of inputs of other logic gates of the same
type.
• Maximum Fan-out for an output specifies the fan-out that
the output can drive with out exceeding its specified
maximum transition time
</p>
</div>	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Power Dissipation</h3>
Every electronic circuit requires a certain amount of power to
operate.
• The power dissipation is a parameter expressed in millwatts
(mW) and represents the amount of power needed by the gate.
• The number that represents this parameter does not include the
power delivered from another gate; rather, it represents the
power delivered to the gate from the power supply.
• An IC with four gates will require, from its power supply, four
times the power dissipated in each gate.
• The amount of power that is dissipated in a gate is calculated as:
P D (Power Dissipation) = V CC * I CC
Where V cc = supply voltage and
I cc = current drawn by the circuit.
<p>
	The current drawn from the power supply when the output
of the gate is in the high-voltage level is termed I CCH .
• When the output is in the low-voltage level, the current is
l CCL .
• The average current is
• And used to calculate the average power dissipation.
	
</p>
</p></div>
	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Noise Margin</h3>
Thus, noise is a term used to denote an undesirable signal that is
superimposed upon the normal operating signal.
• Noise margin is the maximum noise voltage added to an input
signal of a digital circuit that does not cause an undesirable
change in the circuit output.
• The ability of circuits to operate reliably in a noise environment is
important in many applications.
• Noise margin is expressed in volts and represents the maximum
noise signal that can be tolerated by the gate.
• NMH (NOISE MARGIN high) = Voh - Vih
• NML (NOISE MARGIN low) = Vil – Vol

</p></div>
	<div class="courses_row">
<p>
<h3>Sequential Logic </h3>
Every digital system is likely to have
combinational circuits, most systems encountered
in practice also include storage elements, which
require that the system be described in term of
sequential logic.
<p>
	– Output depends not only on current input but also on
past input values, e.g., design a counter
– Need some type of memory to remember the past input
values 
</p>
<p>
	Sequential Logic circuits remember past inputs and past
circuit state.
• Outputs from the system are “feedback” as new inputs
– With gate delay and wire delay
• The storage elements are circuits that are capable of storing
binary information: memory.
</p>
The logic circuit whose outputs at any instant of time depend not only
on the present inputs but also on past outputs are called Sequential
circuits.
• A sequential circuit consists of a combinational circuit to which
storage elements are connected to form a feedback path.
• The storage elements are devices capable of storing binary
information.
• Sequential circuit is slower in operation than combinational circuit
• It may or may not contain clock input.
