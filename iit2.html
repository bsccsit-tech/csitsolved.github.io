						<h3> The Computer System Hardware</h3>
							<a href="#iid2">Are you searching for pdf click me !!</a>
							<br>Functions and Components of a Computer:<br>
A computer does mainly the following four functions:<br>
1. Receive input —Accept data/information from outside
through various input devices like the keyboard, mouse,
scanner, etc.<br>
2. Process information—Perform arithmetic or logical
operations on data/ information.<br>
3. Produce output—Communicate information to the outside
world through output devices like monitor, printer, etc.<br>
4. Store information—Store the information in storage
devices like hard disk, floppy disks, CD, etc.<br>
The hardware components of the computer specialize to do above four
functions.<br>

Functions and Components of a Computer:<br>
▪ Computer hardware falls into two categories: processing
hardware and the peripheral devices.<br>
▪ The Processing hardware consists of the Central
Processing Unit (CPU) where the data processing is done.<br>
▪ Peripheral devices allow people to interact with the CPU.<br>
Together, they make it possible to use the computer for a
variety of tasks.<br>

						<div>
						<h3>  How a Computer Processor Works</h3>
						The working of the CPU is defined as a three-step process.
First, an instruction is fetched from memory.<br>
Second, the instruction is decoded and the processor figures out what it's
being told to do.<br>
Third, the instruction is executed and an operation is performed.<br>
These three steps repeat in a cycle that begins again with the CPU fetching
the next instruction. The steps are referred to as the instruction cycle of the
CPU.<br>
The CPU uses a program counter to keep track of which instruction to fetch
next. The program counter is the address of the memory location that holds
the next instruction to be executed. It's stored in a register, which is a
dedicated memory location in the CPU itself. The program counter is
incremented to point to the next instruction after each fetch in the instruction
cycle.<br>

						<a id="How the CPU Uses Memory"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> How the CPU Uses Memory</h3>
							▪ Computer memory refers to the area where data and programs are stored.<br>
Memory is not part of the CPU, but the CPU must interact closely with it.<br>
▪ There are two types of computer memory: primary, or main, and
secondary. The CPU relies heavily on main memory for storing program
instructions and the data the instructions operate on.<br>
▪ Main memory is temporary in nature and only holds instructions and data
for a program while the program is executing.<br>
▪ Secondary memory is the more permanent storage provided by hard
drives and flash drives.<br>
▪ A component of the CPU known as the control unit is responsible for
moving instructions and data from secondary storage into main memory
prior to instruction execution. The control unit also moves the results of an
instruction to secondary storage.<br>

All general purpose computers require the following hardware
components:<br>
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU): The ‘brain’ of the computer, the
component that actually executes instructions.<br>
2. Memory: It enables a computer to store, at least temporarily,
data and programs.<br>
3. Input device: Usually a keyboard or mouse is used to read data
and programs into the computer.<br>
4. Output device: A display screen, printer, etc. that lets you see
what the computer has accomplished.<br>
5. Mass storage device: It allows a computer to permanently store
large amounts of data. Common mass storage devices include
disk drive and tape drive.<br>

					<div>
						
						<h3> Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
						⚫ Part of the computer that executes program instructions is known as
the processor or Central Processing Unit (CPU).<br>
⚫ In a microcomputer, the CPU is based on a single electronic
component, the microprocessor chip.<br>
⚫ The system unit also includes circuit boards, memory chips, ports
and other components.<br>
⚫ A microcomputer’s system cabinet will also house disk drives, hard
disks, etc., but these are considered separate from the CPU.
The CPU has two parts —The Control Unit (CU) and the Arithmetic
Logic Unit (ALU). In a microcomputer, both are on a single
microprocessor chip.<br>
						</div>	
						<a id="Control Unit (CU)"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> Control Unit (CU)</h3>
						▪ The control unit tells the rest of the computer system how
to carry out a program’s instructions.<br>
▪ It directs the movement of electronic signals between
memory which temporarily holds data, instructions and
processes information - and the ALU.<br>
▪ It also directs these control signals between the CPU and
input/output devices.<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Arithmetic - Logic Unit (ALU)"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> Arithmetic - Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
							
							<br>▪ Arithmetic Logic Unit, usually called the ALU, performs two
types of operations - arithmetical and logical.
▪ Arithmetical operations are the fundamental mathematical
operations consisting of addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division and logical operations.<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Memory"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Memory</h3>
						<br>	▪ Memory - also known as the primary storage or main
memory - is a part of the microcomputer that holds data
and instructions.<br>
▪ Contents of the memory is held only temporarily, that is, it
is stored only as long as the microcomputer is turned on.
▪ When you turn the machine off, the contents are lost.<br>
▪ The capacity of the memory to hold data and program<br>
instructions varies in different computers.
						</div>
						<div>
							<a id="Registers"></a>
						<h3> Registers</h3>
							<br>⚫ Computers also have several additional storage locations
called registers.<br>
⚫ These appear in the Control Unit and ALU and make
processing more efficient.<br>
⚫ Registers are a sort of special hi-speed storage areas that hold
data and instructions temporarily during processing.<br>
⚫ They are parts of the Control Unit and ALU rather than the
memory.<br>
⚫ Their contents can, therefore be handled much faster than the
contents of the memory.<br>
						</div>
						
						<a id="Addresses"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> Addresses</h3>
						<br>	⚫ To locate the characters of data or instructions in the main
memory, the computer stores them in locations known as
addresses.<br>
⚫ A unique number designates each address.<br>
⚫ Addresses can be compared to post office mailboxes.<br>
⚫ Their numbers remain the same, but contents continuously
change.<br>

						<a id="Memory Unit"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Memory Unit  </h3>
					<br>	▪ Memories are made up of registers. Each register in the
memory is one storage location. Storage location is also
called as memory location. Memory locations are
identified using Address. The total number of bit a memory
can store is its capacity.<br>
▪ A storage element is called a Cell. Each register is made
up of storage element in which one bit of data is stored.
The data in a memory are stored and retrieved by the
process called writing and reading respectively.<br>
							
						<br>	▪ A word is a group of bits where a memory unit stores
binary information. A word with group of 8 bits is called a
byte.<br>
▪ A memory unit consists of data lines, address selection
lines, and control lines that specify the direction of
transfer.<br>
							
							
						<br>	▪ Data lines provide the information to be stored in memory.
The control inputs specify the direction transfer. The k-
address lines specify the word chosen.<br>
▪ When there are k address lines, 2k memory word can be
accessed.<br>
						</div>
						
					<a id="Instruction Format"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> Instruction Format </h3>
					<br>	An instruction format defines the different component of
an instruction. The main components of an instruction
are opcode (which instruction to be executed) and
operands (data on which instruction to be executed).<br>
							
						<br>	An instruction format defines the different component of an
instruction. The main components of an instruction are opcode
(which instruction to be executed) and operands (data on
which instruction to be executed).<br>
						</div>	
						<a id="Instruction Set"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Instruction Set  </h3>
					<br>	▪ Instruction set size – It tells the total number of
instructions defined in the processor.<br>
▪ 8085 has 246 instructions.<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Instruction Cycle"></a>
						<div>
						<h3> Instruction Cycle </h3>
					<br>	▪ The instruction cycle (also known as the Fetch–Decode–Execute
cycle or the fetch-execute cycle) is the basic operational process of
a computer system.<br>
▪ The time taken for the execution of an instruction is known
as Instruction Cycle.<br>
▪ It is the process by which a computer retrieves a program
instruction from its memory, determines what actions the instruction
describes, and then carries out those actions.<br>
▪ This cycle is repeated continuously by a computer's central
processing unit (CPU), from boot-up until the computer has shut
down.<br>
▪ In simpler CPUs the instruction cycle is executed sequentially, each
instruction being processed before the next one is started.<br>
▪ But in most modern CPUs the instruction cycles are instead
executed concurrently and often in parallel.<br>
							
						<br>	▪ Instruction cycle can be define as total time required by
the microprocessor to completely fetch and execute an
instruction<br>
▪ An instruction cycle is comprised of one or more number
of machine cycles.<br>
							
							
							<br>Machine Cycle is the sequence of steps in performing the
various operation like opcode fetch, memory read, memory
writes, I/O Read, I/O Write etc.<br>

						<h3> Microprocessor </h3>
						<br>▪ The central processing unit (CPU) is a chip that functions
as the brains of the computer. It is made of transistors--
millions of transistors.<br>
▪ Microprocessors are also the circuitry that surround the
CPU.<br>
▪ The microprocessor is more than the CPU. It contains
other processors, for example, the graphics processor
unit. Sound cards and network cards are encased in
microprocessors. So a CPU is part of a microprocessor,
but a microprocessor is more than the CPU.<br>

▪ The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the core of any
computer, while the microprocessor refers to the whole
functional chip that is inserted into a motherboard. The
CPU is the sub architecture of the microprocessor that
interprets the program instructions and cascade triggers
the sub-functions of each instruction.<br>
