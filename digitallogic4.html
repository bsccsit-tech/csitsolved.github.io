						<h3> Introduction</h3>
							
• Circuits that include flip-flops are usually classified by the
function they perform. Two such circuits are registers and
counters.<a id="Registers"></a><br>
• Registers<br>
 A group of binary cells (FFs) suitable for holding binary data
information.<br>
 In addition to the FFs, a register may have combinational gates
to control when and how the new information is transferred
into the register.<br>
• Counters<br>
 A register that goes through a predetermined sequence of
states upon the application of input pulses.<br>
 The gates in a counter are connected in such a way as to
produce a predefined sequence of binary states in the register.<br>

							<a id="Introduction to Registers"></a>
						<h3>Introduction to Registers  </h3>
						An n-bit register has a group of n flip-flops and
some logic gates and is capable of storing n bits of
information.<br>
 The flip-flops store the information while the gates
control when and how new information is
transferred into the register.<br>
 Some functions of register:<br>
 retrieve data from register<br>
 store/load new data into register (serial or parallel)<br>
 shift the data within register (left or right)<br>
							
							No external gates.<br>
 Example: A 4-bit register. A new 4-bit data is
loaded every clock cycle.<br>
						
						</div>
				<a id="Registers With Parallel Load"></a>		
			<div>
						<h3>  Registers With Parallel Load</h3>
						 Instead of loading the register at every clock pulse, we may
want to control when to load.<br>
 Loading a register: transfer new information into the register.
Requires a load control input.<br>
 Parallel loading: all bits are loaded simultaneously.<br>
						</div>			
						<a id="Shift Registers"></a>
						
						<div> 
						
						<h3>  Shift Registers</h3>
						 Another function of a register, besides storage, is to provide
for data movements.<br>
 Each stage (flip-flop) in a shift register represents one bit of
storage, and the shifting capability of a register permits the
movement of data from stage to stage within the register, or
into or out of the register upon application of clock pulses.<br>
 A register capable of shifting its binary information either to
the right or to the left is called a shift register.<br>
 The logical configuration of a shift register consists of a
chain of flip-flops connected in cascade, with the output of
one flip-flop connected to the input of the next flip-flop.<br>
 All flip-flops receive a common clock pulse that causes the
shift from one stage to the next.<br>

• Generally, shift registers operate in one of four different modes with
the basic movement of data through a shift register being:<br>
• Serial-in to Parallel-out (SIPO) - the register is loaded with serial data,
one bit at a time, with the stored data being available in parallel form.<br>
• Serial-in to Serial-out (SISO) - the data is shifted serially "IN" and
"OUT" of the register, one bit at a time in either a left or right direction
under clock control.<br>
• Parallel-in to Serial-out (PISO) - the parallel data is loaded into the
register simultaneously and is shifted out of the register serially one bit
at a time under clock control.<br>
• Parallel-in to parallel-out (PIPO)<br>
– the parallel data is loaded
simultaneously into the
register, and transferred
together to their respective
outputs by the same clock pulse.<br>

						<a id="Serial-in to Parallel-out (SIPO) Shift Register"></a>
						
					<div>
						
						<h3> Serial-in to Parallel-out (SIPO) Shift
Register</h3>
					Accepts data serially.<br>
 Outputs of all stages are available simultaneously.<br>
						
						• Lets assume that all the flip-flops ( FFA to FFD ) have just been RESET
( CLEAR input ) and that all the outputs Q A to Q D are at logic level “0” ie,
no parallel data output.<br>
• If a logic “1” is connected to the DATA input pin of FFA then on the first
clock pulse the output of FFA and therefore the resulting Q A will be set
HIGH to logic “1” with all the other outputs still remaining LOW at logic
“0”.<br>
• Assume now that the DATA input pin of FFA has returned LOW again to
logic “0” giving us one data pulse or 0-1-0.<br>
• The second clock pulse will change the output of FFA to logic “0” and the
output of FFB and Q B HIGH to logic “1” as its input D has the logic “1”
level on it from Q A .<br>
• When the third clock pulse arrives this logic “1” value moves to the output
of FFC ( Q C ) and so on until the arrival of the fifth clock pulse which sets
all the outputs Q A to Q D back again to logic level “0” because the input to
FFA has remained constant at logic level “0”.<br>
						
					<br>	• The effect of each clock pulse is to shift the data contents of
each stage one place to the right, and this is shown in the
following table until the complete data value of 0-0-0-1 <br>
			
					<br>	 Accepts data serially – one bit at a time – and also
produces output serially.<br>
						• This shift register is very similar to the SIPO except the data was read directly
in a parallel form from the outputs Q A to Q D in SIPO, but the data is allowed to
flow straight through the register and data out in the other end.<br>
• Since there is only one output, the DATA leaves the shift register one bit at a
time in a serial pattern, hence the name Serial-in to Serial-Out Shift Register
or SISO.<br>
						</div>	
						
						<a id="Parallel In/Serial Out Shift Registers"></a>
					<div>
						
						<h3> Parallel In/Serial Out Shift Registers</h3>
					<br>	 Bits are entered simultaneously, but output is serial.<br>
 The data is loaded into the register in a parallel in which all the data
bits enter their inputs simultaneously, to the parallel input pins P A to
P D of the register.<br>
 The data is read out sequentially in the normal shift-right mode from
the register at Q representing the data present at P A to P D .<br>
 It is important to note that in this type of shift register a clock pulse is
not required to parallel load the register as it is already present, but
four clock pulses are required to unload the data.<br>
						
						
						 Simultaneous input and output of all data bits.
 The data is presented in a parallel format to the parallel input pins P A
to P D and then transferred together directly to their respective output
pins Q A to Q D by the same clock pulse.<br>

						<a id="Counters"></a>
			<div>
						<h3>Counters</h3>
				
			<br>	 Counters are circuits that cycle through a specified number
of states.
 Two types of counters:<br>
 synchronous (parallel) counters<br>
 asynchronous (ripple) counters<br>
 Ripple counters allow some flip-flop outputs to be used as
a source of clock for other flip-flops.<br>
 Synchronous counters apply the same clock to all flip-
flops.<br>
						</div>			
						
						<a id="Asynchronous (Ripple) Counters"></a>
				<div>
						<h3> Asynchronous (Ripple) Counters</h3>
					
				<br>	 Asynchronous counters: the flip-flops do not change states
at exactly the same time as they do not have a common
clock pulse.<br>
 Also known as ripple counters, as the input clock pulse
“ripples” through the counter – cumulative delay is a
drawback.<br>
 n flip-flops  a MOD (modulus) 2 n counter. (Note: A
MOD-x counter cycles through x states.)<br>
 Output of the last flip-flop (MSB) divides the input clock
frequency by the MOD number of the counter, hence a
counter is also a frequency divider.<br>
					
					• Idea:<br>
– to connect the output of one flip-flop to the C input of
the next high-order flip-flop
• We need “complementing” flip-flops<br>
– We can use T flip-flops to obtain complementing flip-
flops or<br>
– JK flip-flops with its inputs are tied together<br>
						</div>		
						
						<a id="2 bit Ripple binary up Counters"></a>
					<div>
						
						<h3> 2 bit Ripple binary up Counters</h3>
						Output of one flip-flop is connected to the clock input of the next
more-significant flip-flop.<br>
						</div>	
					<a id="Binary Ripple Counter"></a>	
					<div>
						<h3>Binary Ripple Counter</h3>
					<br>	 Operation
 It is obvious that the lowest-order bit A 1 must be complemented with
each count pulse.<br>
 Every time A 1 goes from 1 to 0, it complements A 2 .<br>
 Every time A 2 goes from 1 to 0, it complements A 3 .<br>
 Every time A 3 goes from 1 to 0, it complements A 4 , and so on.<br>
• The flip-flops change one at a time in rapid succession, and the signal
propagates through the counter in a ripple fashion.<br>
						
						</div>	
						<a id="BCD Ripple Counter (Decade Counter)"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>BCD Ripple Counter (Decade Counter)</h3>
						<br>	• These counters have 10 states in their sequence.
• A decade counter of states from 0000 to 1001 is called a BCD decade
counter.<br>
• Since the counter would have 16 states, it is forces to recycle before going
through all of its possible state.<br>
• The BCD decade counter is recycled to 0000 after the 1001 state.<br>
• Such a counter must have at least four flip-flops to represent each decimal
digit, since a decimal digit is represented by a binary code with at least
four bits.<br>
• The sequence of states in a decimal counter is dictated by the binary code
used to represent a decimal digit.<br>
						<br>	• Operation:<br>
• When CP input goes from 1 to 0, the flip-flop is set if J = 1, is cleared
if K = 1, is complemented if J = K = 1, and is left unchanged if J = K =
0. The following are the conditions for each flip-flop state transition:
1. Q 1 is complemented on the negative edge of every count pulse.
2. Q 2 is complemented if Q 8 = 0 and Q 1 goes from 1 to 0. Q 2 is cleared if
Q 8 = 1 and Q 1 goes from 1 to 0.
3. Q 4 is complemented when Q 2 goes from 1 to 0.
4. Q 8 is complemented when Q 4 Q 2 = 11 and Q 1 goes from 1 to 0. Q 8 is
cleared if either Q 4 or Q2 is 0 and Q1 goes from 1 to 0.

						<a id="Synchronous (Parallel) Counters"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Synchronous (Parallel) Counters </h3>
					<br>	• Synchronous counters are distinguished from ripple counters in that
clock pulses are applied to the CP inputs of all flip-flops.<br>
• Synchronous counters are counters in which all the flip-flops are
triggered simultaneously(in parallel) by the clock input pulses.<br>
• All the FFs change state simultaneously in synchronization with the
clock pulse.<br>
• The decision whether a flip-flop is to be complemented or not is
determined from the values of the J and K inputs at the time of the pulse.
– If J = K = 0, the flip-flop remains unchanged. If J = K = 1, the flip-
flop complements.<br>
• Synchronous counters have the advantage of high speed but the
disadvantage of having more circuitry than that of asynchronous counters<br>
							
						<br>	• Design procedure is so simple
– no need for going through sequential
logic design process<br>
– A 0 is always complemented<br>
– A 1 is complemented when A 0 = 1<br>
– A 2 is complemented when A 0 = 1 and A 1 = 1<br>
– so on<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Binary Up-Down Counter"></a>
					<div>
						<h3>Binary Up-Down Counter </h3>
					<br>	• When counting downward<br>
– the least significant bit is always complemented (with
each clock pulse)<br>
– A bit in any other position is complemented if all lower
significant bits are equal to 0.<br>
• Up down Counter operation<br>
– When up= 1, the circuit counts up, since the T inputs
receive their signals from the values of the previous
normal outputs of the flip-flops.<br>
– When down= 1 and up= 0, the circuit counts down<br>
						
						</div>	
						<a id="Synchronous BCD Counter"></a>
		<div>
						<h3>Synchronous BCD Counter </h3>
						
						<br>• A BCD Counter is nothing but a mod 10 counter.
• It requires 4 FFs<br>
• A BCD counter counts in binary-coded decimal from 0000 to 1001 and
back to 0000 where states 0000 through 1001 are stable.<br>
• States 1010 through 1111 are invalid.<br>
• After the tenth clock pulse, the counter resets.<br>
• Because of the return to 0 after a count of 9, a BCD counter does not
have a regular pattern as in a straight binary count.<br>
• To derive the circuit of a BCD synchronous counter, it is necessary to
go through a design procedure discussed earlier.<br>
• The flip-flop input functions from the excitation table can be
simplified by means of maps.<br>
– The unused states for minterms 10 to 15 are taken as don't-care
terms.<br>

						<a id="Counter Design Example"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Counter Design Example </h3>
					<h4>	Please Download the pdf from footer of this site for step 1,2,3</h4>	
					<br>	Step 4: Karnaugh Map<br>
 Transfer the J and K states from the transition table to K-
maps<br>
 There is a K-map for each input of each flip-flop.<br>
Step 5: Logic Expression for FF inputs<br>
 Group the K-map cells to generate and derive the logic
expression for each flip-flop input.<br>
Step 6: Counter Implementation<br>
 Implement the expressions with combinational logic,<br>
and combine with the flip-flops to create the counter.<br>
					<br>	• Designing a counter with the irregular binary
sequence 1-> 2 -> 5 -> 7<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Timing Sequences"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Timing Sequences </h3>
						
					<br>	• The sequences of operations in a digital system are
specified by a control unit.<br>
• The control unit that supervises the operations in a
digital system would normally consist of timing
signals that determine the time sequence in which
the operations are executed.<br>
• The timing sequences in the control unit can be
easily generated by means of counters or shift
registers<br>
						</div>
						<a id="Word-Time Generation"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Word-Time Generation </h3>
					<br>	• The control unit in a serial computer must generate a word-time signal
that stays on for a number of pulses equal to the number of bits in the
shift registers.<br>
• The word-time signal can be generated by means of a counter that
counts the required number of pulses.<br>
• Initially, the 3-bit counter is cleared to 0. A start signal will set flip-
flop Q. The output of this flip-flop supplies the word-time control and
also enables the counter. After the count of eight pulses, the flip-flop is
reset and Q goes to 0.
						<br>	
							<br>• The start signal is synchronized with the clock and stays on for one
clock-pulse period.<br>
• After Q is set to 1, the counter starts counting the clock pulses. When the
counter reaches the count of 7 (binary 111), it sends a stop signal to the
reset input of the flip-flop.<br>
• The stop signal becomes a 1 after the negative-edge transition of pulse 7<br>
• The next clock pulse switches the counter to the 000 state and also clears
Q and the word-time signal stays at 0.<br>

						<a id="Timing Signals"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Timing Signals </h3>
						• The control unit in a digital system that operates in the parallel mode
must generate timing signals that stay on for only one clock pulse
period.
• Timing signals that control the sequence of operations in a digital
system can be generated with a shift register or a counter with a
decoder.
• A ring counter is a circular shift register with only one flip-flop being
set at any particular time, all others are cleared.
• The single bit is shifted from one flip-flop to the other to produce the
sequence of timing signals.
							
							• To generate 2 n timing signals,
– we need a shift register with 2 n flip-flops
• or, we can construct the ring counter with a binary counter
and a decoder
						
						</div>
						<a id="Johnson Counter"></a>
						<div>
						<h3>Johnson Counter </h3>
					<br>	• The Johnson counter, also known as the twisted-ring counter, is exactly the
same as the ring counter except that the inverted output of the last flip-flop
is connected to the input of the first flip-flop.<br>
• The number of states can be doubled if the shift register is connected as a
switch-tail ring counter<br>
• A k-bit ring counter can generate k distinguishable states<br>
• Total number of used states= 2*n<br>
• Total number of unused states= 2 n – 2*n<br>
						
						<br>	• Count sequence and required decoding<br>
							
							<a id="Advantages of Johnson counter"></a>
						<br>	Advantages of Johnson counter:<br>
• The Johnson counter has same number of flip flop but it can count twice
the number of states the ring counter can count.<br>
• It can be implemented using D and JK flip flop.<br>
• Johnson ring counter is used to count the data in a continuous loop.<br>
• Johnson counter is a self-decoding circuit.<br>
							<a id="Disadvantages of Johnson counter"></a>
<br>Disadvantages of Johnson counter:<br>
• Johnson counter doesn’t count in a binary sequence.<br>
• In Johnson counter more number of states remain unutilized than the
number of states being utilized.<br>
• The number of flip flops needed is one half the number of timing signals.<br>
• It can be constructed for any number of timing sequence.<br>

						<div>
						<h3>Memory unit </h3>
						<br>• A memory unit is a collection of storage cells together with
associated circuits needed to transfer information in and
out of the device.<br>
• Memory cells can be accessed for information transfer to
or from any desired random location and hence the name
random access memory, abbreviated RAM.<br>
• A memory unit stores binary information in groups of bits
called words.<br>
• A word in memory is an entity of bits that move in and out
of storage as a unit.<br>
• A memory word is a group of 1's and 0's and may
represent a number, an instruction, one or more
alphanumeric characters, or any other binary-coded
information.<br>

						<h3>Integrated Circuit memory (Binary Cell- BC) </h3>
					<br>	The internal construction of a random-access memory of m words with
n bits per word consists of m x n binary storage cells and associated
decoding circuits for selecting individual words. The binary storage
cell is the basic building block of a memory unit
